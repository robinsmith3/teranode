# Teranode Internet Lab
This Git Teranode project is to support a Bitcoin SV project to build a routed virtual Internet using BGP and IPv6 Muticast 

## Projects:
- gns3_configs.py - a script to manage GNS3 router config files through their lifecycles

## Caveats
- this script was specifically to handle dynampis hypervisor nodes. You may have to send it back to Grok for an update for any other VM kind
- the script does not handle any Cisco IOS config errors but they will be notified during execution
